**What is CI & CD?**
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies ot a shared mainline several times a day.

Continuous delivery (CD) is a software enginerring approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently.

**Benefits?**
One of the key driving forces behind CI and CD is to detect problems or bugs as early as possible in the development lifecycle. The faster feedback loop inevitably results in better quality software since the builds are automated and the source is integrated and continuously built and deployed.

Key take-aways:
- Reduced risk
- Increased confidence
- Better quality code
- Ready to ship code
- Systematic versioning
- Code quality trend analysis
- Time to market
- Reduced cost
