### Tips
- Keep notes simple and straightforward
    - Only write down keywords or a few sentences about the subject
- use abbreviations
- add pictures to minimize long blocks of text 
- try other methods of study other than typing notes (i.e. flash cards for active recall)

### Outline Method
1) **Title Section**
- Name
- Date
- Note title/subject

    2) **Main Topic**
    - Vocabulary words
    - Important words
    - Questions
        
        3) **Subtopic**
        -  Categories
        - Supporting Concepts

            4) **Supporting Detail**
            - Main notes
            - Detailed Explanation
            - Definitions
            - Answers

#### Example
**Describe the risk factors of lung cancer** `Title Section #1`
1. Tobacco `Main Topic #2`
    - #1 leading cause of lung cancer  `Subtopic #3`
    - increase risk with cummaltive exposure

2. Radiation Exposure `Main Topic #2`
    - Medical Imaging `Subtopic #3`
        - CT, PET scan `Supporting Detail #4` 
    - Radon radioactive gas 
        - common indoor 


#### Learning New Skills

- Learning Model
    - Indexing:
        - Gather as many resources as you can. Index the topics in your brain. Goal is to simply learn about the topics, separating out good resources from the bad ones. Do not implement things at this stage.
        - Ex: Watch tutorial on how to build REST API's in Python from end to end. Do not try to implement or follow the tutorial by actually doing what it asks you to do. Take some basic notes, maybe even watch at twice the speed. Goal is just to index, so at the end of this phase you will have a good understanding on what topics to learn. Maybe some surface level understanding on these topics.
            - *The problem* with simply following the tutorial without actually understanding all it covers, it has a tendency to give you **false competence**.

    - Retaining:
        - Go in depth about topics you are reading about.
        - **Space Repition:**
            - Learn new topic on days: 1, 2, 3 and instead of moving on to a new topic on day 4, you go back and review topic on day 1 before proceeding onto new topics on day 5, 6..and so forth.
        - At the end of this phase, you should have enough information or learned enough on the topic(s) to implement whatever it is you've learned.

    - Referencing
        - Because you've spent so much time curating the resources and going over them -- you'll know exactly where to reference material from that you may have not spent much recent time on. You will also pick it up much more quickly because it is a nth time you've reviewed this information.

- 80/20 principle
    - How do you decide which skills to drop and which skills to continue investing on? 
        - 80% of your investment to learning something new should be on something that directly impacts your life and your wellbeing.
        - 20% of the time, invest on learning things that are out of pure curiousity.
